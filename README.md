## Project Proposal
**Project Title.**
Temptare is attempt in Latin and this will be my attempt at game development, so I
think it is a fitting name.

**Background.**
All my life, I have been passionate about video games. Up until about high school,
I was only passionate about playing them, not creating them. However, after playing Skyrim for a
while, I became uninterested with the original game and began downloading mods. After exploring
mods for a while, I became bored with other people’s creations and desired to make my own. I
downloaded the Skyrim Creation Kit and customized Skyrim myself. Later in high school, I made
simple Javascript, HTML, and CSS two-dimensional video games loosely similar to Space Invaders.
Once I got to college, lack of free time and simply exploring other interests put my passion for
developing video games on a back burner. Now this year, with my graduation looming, I had been
extremely stressed out with my lack of direction in the industries I wanted to apply to for my first job
after college. However, Noelle Warner’s Purposeful Pathway, Early Access: My Experience In The
Video Game Industry, reignited my interest for making video games. One thing she mentioned was
that to even be considered when trying to get your foot in the door in the industry, it was necessary
to have a tangible project you could present when you interview or apply. Besides my final project
for CSC-344, Computer Graphics and Image Processing, I do not have any projects that I am proud
enough of to show future employers. Additionally, I would not really consider the project to be
a game. Also, the project was written in ThreeJS, but Mrs. Warner mentioned that most game
development companies utilize game engines, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and Blender. Going into
this class, I did not have any experience with such game engines, so my experience was lacking in
that department. Altogether, I am passionate about playing and developing video games, but I do not
have a project that I would actively want to show employers and I have a lot to learn about what goes
into constructing video games.

**Goal.** 
My proposed solution to those problems would be to construct a video game for the final
project. More specifically, I desire to make a Virtual Reality first-person shooter and environmental
lore video game in Unity. I know I will put in one hundred ten percent effort so at the end of this
project, I will be left something that I will be proud to show potential future employers. Additionally,
the project will give me insight in programming with C#, techniques for using game engine software,
and conceptual ideas behind game design. A stretch goal is implementing artificial intelligence into
my video game. Dr. Alvin informed me that he has books on artificial intelligence and am planning
on borrowing them from him. If adding artificial intelligence is feasible for my project in a reasonable
time period that does not detract from other aspects of the game, I would be highly interesting in
doing so.


**Methods.**
A technique I am hoping on being able to use is uploading the three-dimensional scan
of Riley Hall into Unity. I currently do not have access to the scan, but I reached out to admissions
to try and obtain it. Unfortunately, they did not have access to it, so they reached out to IT services,
who also did not have access to it. Admissions told me they also reached out to Communication
Studies, but I have not heard back, so I am planning on going in-person to their office in Furman
Furman CSC-475 Seminar in Computer Science
hall in order to follow-up. If I did gain access to the scan and was successfully able to load it into
Unity, the first-person shooter aspect of the game would be something harmless like paintball. A
key component of my proposed solution is using Unity. Unity has a collection of tutorials on their
website that aids users in their attempts to learn the software as well as construct games. Currently, I
have gone through the VR Development Pathway and learned in-depth how to set up VR projects,
how VR interaction works, building VR projects, and constructing scenes in Unity using prefabs and
other assets [1]. Another key component of my project is scripting. Currently, I have added scripts
that spawn projectiles on a key press as well as animate the projectiles. I used the book Introduction
to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development: From Concept to Playable Game with Unity and
C# by Jeremy Gibson Bond to learn the syntax for C# (Chapters 16 through 28) [2]. I used the online
tutorial on This Code Does This to walk me through projectile motion [3]. Additionally, I want to
explore Raycasting in C#, so I will read the Unity Documentation for it [4]. There will be many other
aspects of game development that I will need to research so I will continuously be adding references
to my project.

**Evaluation.** 
I will qualitatively evaluate the success of my project by playing the video game and
seeing how much enjoyment I gain from it. Therefore, the success of my project will be very abstract.
I will definitely get feedback from others who play my game as well.

**Dissemination.**
I will publish the program to either App Lab or Rift through the Meta Quest
Developer Hub, then I will post the code on GitHub. Alternatively, I will probably not publish my
final report as I do know who would want to read it. Also, I am planning on having a live demo of my
project at Furman Engaged.


## 1 Literature Review
Virtual Reality is a useful resource with applications in teaching and immersion. For context, Jaron
Lanier coined the term in the early 1980s, making it a relatively recent domain. In this paper, Virtual
Reality will be defined as “an advanced interface for computer applications, which allows the user to
navigate and interact, in real-time, with a three-dimensional computer-generated environment, using
multisensorial devices” [5]. The advancing technology of Virtual Reality empowers users to interact
with settings and situations not easily reproduced by traditional media.

As a teaching resource, Virtual Reality can assist instructors in several ways. It enhances traditional
learning methods by providing safe and controlled environments, ensuring ease of repetition, and
increasing learner motivation (enjoyment). The provision of safe and controlled environments is a
necessity for fields such as disaster training as well as medical training [6][7].

Both disaster and medical training involve preparing for high stakes events that are difficult to simulate
outside of Virtual Reality. Simulating disaster or medical procedures, such as surgeries, could put
subjects at risk; however, since the subject would not be a real person in Virtual Reality, such risk
is eliminated. Furthermore, the field of special education benefits from the assurance of safe and
controlled environments [8]. Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder can experience exposure
therapy to social situations without the fear of being made fun of afterwards due to perceived failures
in such situations. Therefore, Virtual Reality supplies the opportunity to participate in learning
environments without limiting factors due to fear or safety concerns. It opens the door for more
people to experience useful or imperative training that they previously would not have had due to the
drawbacks of traditional learning methods.

Additional drawbacks of traditional learning methods, besides fear and the lack of safety guarantees,
are monetary and time costs. Virtual Reality’s ability to administer repetition is beneficial for teaching,
because it can reduce expenses, supplies, and time consumption. Using Virtual Reality, students
can repeat scenarios as many times as necessary or desired to master skills at no additional cost [6].
When setting up repeated exercises in traditional learning formats, one potentially has to possess
multiple copies of certain supplies, and in turn, spend more money and waste time putting the supplies
together to construct the scenarios. However, Virtual Reality does this with one touch of a button.

Virtual Reality increases the enjoyment of training in more ways than making repetition easier, it also
improves training by increasing learner motivation, or enjoyment, consequently, alleviating boredom
and frustration. Virtual Reality escalates entertainment, "as the sense of spatial presence is enjoyable
and encourages students to cognitively engage in the acquisition of knowledge" [9]. Since students
are more entertained with subject material through Virtual Reality, they are less likely to succumb
to distraction or burnout. Virtual Reality is a method of interactivity of instruction, which engages
learners more than less immersive educational techniques. Therefore, Virtual Reality is a desirable
commodity for teaching as it reduces the dullness of such teaching by keeping students included and
namely interested in their learning.

Keeping students engrossed in their learning can in some ways be attributed to the immersive nature
of Virtual Reality. The immersive characteristic of Virtual Reality also coincides with aiding the
quality of students’ learning by reducing the need for students’ proficiency in visuospatial imagery.
According to Christian Harmann et al., "visuospatial imagery describes an individual’s ability to
create detailed mental spatial representations that allow individuals to fill in memory gaps and
construct comprehensive spatial models, even when spatial data is scarce" [9]. In other words, Virtual
Reality fills in many situational blanks that traditional learning techniques leave out, making it up
to the student to use their imagination to fill in the blanks themselves. If students have a difficulty
with filling in such blanks, traditional learning techniques can leave them disheartened or frustrated.
Virtual Reality removes origins of such frustrations to improve students’ quality of learning.

In addition to adding a spatial presence, immersion also allows Virtual Reality to facilitate effective
collaboration between users. A drawback that has been attributed to Virtual Reality is one of isolation.
Virtual Reality has been labeled as isolating, because one cannot interact with others directly around
oneself while using the technology [10]. However, the immersive nature of Virtual Reality promotes
interpersonal communication in other ways. Virtual Reality has the capability of replicating any
possible collaborative scenario [11]. Furthermore, equal levels of inter-brain synchrony occur during
the same activity in Virtual Reality as in real life; inter-brain synchrony can be explained as the
neurons in multiple peoples’ brains synchronizing due to collaboration on the same task or interaction
with one another. Therefore, interacting with others in Virtual Reality is cognitively the same as
taking the headset off and interacting with those around oneself.

Not only can Virtual Reality allow one to experience realistic feelings of collaboration, it can also
lead to realistic feelings of body ownership of the virtual character one is controlling. Interactions
with the user’s virtual body can be perceived as occurring towards the user’s own physical body when
using Virtual Reality. According to Mel Slater et al., "the illusory perception of a fake limb as part
of our own body through the alteration of the normal association and its visual correlate occurs in
Virtual Reality" [12]. Moreover, even if the virtual character does not resemble the user, the user will
still experience a body ownership illusion, when using Virtual Reality. Therefore, Virtual Reality
provides a truly immersive experience in which the user perceives actions performed and received as
truly done by themselves.

One application of Virtual Reality as a learning tool can be to teach gun safety. Gun safety is a very
important topic in the United States at the moment. According to Megan L. Ranney et al., "firearm
injury and death are a major public health problem, with more than 40,000 deaths and an estimated
85,000-130,000 injuries a year" [13]. Specifically related to hunting, there are approximately 20
instances in which hunters accidentally shoot someone instead of a deer each year in the United
States [14]. Evidently, there is a necessity to offer an accessible, educational tool to encourage gun
safety to the American populace.

My project will act as an outlet for teaching gun safety in an immersive and interactive manner
through Virtual Reality. There is currently an interactive web platform being developed with a
completion date in March of this year by researchers at the University of Alabama to teach children
hunting, shooting, and firearms safety [15]. However, my project will be different because the one
currently being developed will not be in Virtual Reality, but mine will. My project will be able to be
utilized to realistically teach gun safety through negatively reinforcing the aiming and shooting of
friendly targets without the danger of using an actual gun. In addition, engagement and motivation
will be values at the center of the development of my project. Since it is in Virtual Reality, users will
hopefully gain more than from traditional learning techniques teaching gun safety.
